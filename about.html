<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Ethan, and I am a junior studying computer science at boise state. I am interested in the design of applications and websites, specifically how it looks and feels for someone to interact with it.<br>My goal is that, when this website is finished, it will look nice and feel just as nice to use. Maybe I could use it to land a job! Either way, this website is far from finished, and likely will stay this way until around December. Thanks for visiting :)</p><br><br><br>
